Important Dates:

May 17th: 
     - The idea was created by our very own Jack, with Aryan and Eugene adding onto the idea to make the game more enjoyable.
     - The project proposal was created by Eugene, detailing the narrative behind the game as well as the tentative rules and regulations
	 
May 19th: 

     - Our repo was made, as well as the beginning of the development log and the plan file.

May 23rd:

    Today we ironed out details about structure of our game. We decided
    that a 2D Array or Matrix would be best for our game. We also decided
    use orthagonal distance to illuminate unvisited maze paths. We had a long
    debate over using Aryan's 2 orthogonal squares away from the player vs my
    using vision radius vs Eugenio's 1 orthogonal square from the player idea.
    Was a productive day because we were able to put that design choice to bed as
    well as let each other see what we were perceiving what the game would be in
    our minds. Now I'm going to list some of the design choices I believe we have
    made.

    Player:
	A sphere on the map, smaller than the tiles which comprise the paths/walls

    Walls/Path:
	Each shall be a tile on the map, or a rectangular space that designates whether
	or not the player can occupy it. Each tile is illuminated when the player is 1
	orthagonal square away.

    Obstacles:
	Obstacles will likely be smaller than the tiles in which they reside and cause the
	player to restart the map they are on with one less life when hit by the player.
	They may move within the tile they reside. We may also choose to implement an
		intensity feature in which the closer a player gets to an obstacles, regardless of
	whether it's square is illuminated, the brighter the outline of the obstacles will be.

    Exit:
	Randomly generated in each map and may or may not implement the intensity feature.

May 25th:

    Today a team representative met with Mr. Brown in order to make sure that the team was on
    the right track and to see if there were any measures they could take in the future to make
    sure deliverables were delirvered on time and in good quality.

    The solutions proposed were:
    	- 2 group members will commit to print out hard copies
	- Each assignment will be emailed to each group member as text and reviewed upon completion
	line by line to ensure all directives have been accomplished
	- Receipts for commits and work will be sent to other group members upon completion to ensure
	that the assignment is done

    The yellow light status of the project was also discussed. Mr. Brown said that the most rich part
    of the proposal was the maze generation aspect. The idea of researching algorithms instead of trying
    to blindly make one was reaffirmed. A group member later looked up different maze generation algorithms
    and understood the process much better. The proposal to skype and discuss the algorithms was proposed
    but did not work out due to schedule conflicts amongst the group. The plan is for the group to discuss the
    algs today in class and make sure each member understands the algs so that we can better implement them.

May 28th:

    -Jack
    Today I got a nice breakfast and decided to code the maze alg in a park. Coding outside is actually quite calm
    however a lack of wifi can stifle productivity. Luckily a hotspot saved me from not having access to the Processing
    reference page. I coded the tile and wall classes with a wall being a child of a tile since a wall is just a type of
    tile. I utilized the randomized depth first search algo to make the first maze generating algo but there is currently
    a bug in which certain tiles that are unvisited are marked as visited, messing up the maze traversal. Not sure what's
    causing it as of now but going to dive in tomorrow with the help of my team to resolve it.
   
    -Eugene
    Due to a busy schedule, I did not have a machine at my disposal; however, while at work and then at my aunt's house, I thought
    of how the character class would be utilized in the grand scheme of the project. At first, I followed the UML that was available, 
    but I quickly learned that it was subject to change based on what I brainstormed. While brainstorming I thought of the three essential
    questions: What? How? And Why? After being able to answer all three of those questions for various methods, I had a mental image of 
    what I wanted the character class to be like. 

May 29th:

    -Jack
    I debugged the thing by changing the line that fills gaps between cells from creating a new cell to typecasting the wall
    as a cell. Added a bunch of comments to explain everything too. The maze generator is pretty cool.
    Also just fixed the backtrack tracker and made it nicer.
	
    -Eugene 
    After looking in shock and amazement at the maze generation, the Character class was written with various methods. One of the main 
    issues I was having, was relating the Character class back with the maze that was generated (this stemming from my lack of understanding 
    of the totality of Processing still). Luckily, Aryan fleshed out all of the issues I had and was truly the savior of the Character class. 
    In addition, the readMe was written by me, detailing what our current deliverable presentation had relative to what we want when the assignment is due. 

May 30th:
 
     As a collective, we discussed what remains now that we have an algorithm for building a maze. In this discussion, we arrived to two 
     classes of goals that we have: goals that are integral to the game and goals that can be used to robustify our game. Some of the goals
     that are integral to the game include ironing out the issues of the character class and allowing it to interact with the entire game board 
     with coded keys. One of the most interesting ideas that was spawned from this discussion in class was the fact that we should include multiple 
     algorithms for developing a maze, each producing a maze of a different difficulty. At home, we completed the homework assignments, keeping in 
     mind the ideas from class.

June 2nd: 

    Today was the day that both Aryan and Eugene were going to be absent. Thus, Jack decided to spend that period fleshing out his maze generation algorithm
    as well as working on the character class to ensure that it works. By the end of this period/day, our character class was 100% fully functional and you were
    able to solve every possible maze and when you reach the exit square, the screen would close. 

June 3rd: 

    Today, we finalized which maze generation responsibilities each of us had. As you already know, Jack was responsible for the Depth Search Maze Generation Algorithm
    that was utilized in our first level. Eugene is in charge of the Eller's method for maze generation which involves subdividing sets at random and joining the two sets
    at random. For Eller's those sets are then continuously connected vertically down the maze and once you reach the bottom of the maze, you are done. Aryan is in charge
    of doing Prim's algorithm which select a random square and gradiates outward.
