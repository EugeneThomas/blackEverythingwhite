Important Dates:

May 17th: 
     - The idea was created by our very own Jack, with Aryan and Eugene adding onto the idea to make the game more enjoyable.
     - The project proposal was created by Eugene, detailing the narrative behind the game as well as the tentative rules and regulations
	 
May 19th: 

     - Our repo was made, as well as the beginning of the development log and the plan file.

May 23rd:

    Today we ironed out details about structure of our game. We decided
    that a 2D Array or Matrix would be best for our game. We also decided
    use orthagonal distance to illuminate unvisited maze paths. We had a long
    debate over using Aryan's 2 orthogonal squares away from the player vs my
    using vision radius vs Eugenio's 1 orthogonal square from the player idea.
    Was a productive day because we were able to put that design choice to bed as
    well as let each other see what we were perceiving what the game would be in
    our minds. Now I'm going to list some of the design choices I believe we have
    made.

    Player:
	A sphere on the map, smaller than the tiles which comprise the paths/walls

    Walls/Path:
	Each shall be a tile on the map, or a rectangular space that designates whether
	or not the player can occupy it. Each tile is illuminated when the player is 1
	orthagonal square away.

    Obstacles:
	Obstacles will likely be smaller than the tiles in which they reside and cause the
	player to restart the map they are on with one less life when hit by the player.
	They may move within the tile they reside. We may also choose to implement an
	intensity feature in which the closer a player gets to an obstacles, regardless of
	whether it's square is illuminated, the brighter the outline of the obstacles will be.

    Exit:
	Randomly generated in each map and may or may not implement the intensity feature.
