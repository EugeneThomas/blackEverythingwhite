Important Dates:

May 17th: 
     - The idea was created by our very own Jack, with Aryan and Eugene adding onto the idea to make the game more enjoyable.
     - The project proposal was created by Eugene, detailing the narrative behind the game as well as the tentative rules and regulations
	 
May 19th: 

     - Our repo was made, as well as the beginning of the development log and the plan file.

May 23rd:

    Today we ironed out details about structure of our game. We decided
    that a 2D Array or Matrix would be best for our game. We also decided
    use orthagonal distance to illuminate unvisited maze paths. We had a long
    debate over using Aryan's 2 orthogonal squares away from the player vs my
    using vision radius vs Eugenio's 1 orthogonal square from the player idea.
    Was a productive day because we were able to put that design choice to bed as
    well as let each other see what we were perceiving what the game would be in
    our minds. Now I'm going to list some of the design choices I believe we have
    made.

    Player:
	A sphere on the map, smaller than the tiles which comprise the paths/walls

    Walls/Path:
	Each shall be a tile on the map, or a rectangular space that designates whether
	or not the player can occupy it. Each tile is illuminated when the player is 1
	orthagonal square away.

    Obstacles:
	Obstacles will likely be smaller than the tiles in which they reside and cause the
	player to restart the map they are on with one less life when hit by the player.
	They may move within the tile they reside. We may also choose to implement an
		intensity feature in which the closer a player gets to an obstacles, regardless of
	whether it's square is illuminated, the brighter the outline of the obstacles will be.

    Exit:
	Randomly generated in each map and may or may not implement the intensity feature.

May 25th:

    Today a team representative  met with Mr. Brown in order to make sure that the team was on
    the right track and to see if there were any measures they could take in the future to make
    sure deliverables were delirvered on time and in good quality.

    The solutions proposed were:
    	- 2 group members will commit to print out hard copies
	- Each assignment will be emailed to each group member as text and reviewed upon completion
	line by line to ensure all directives have been accomplished
	- Receipts for commits and work will be sent to other group members upon completion to ensure
	that the assignment is done

    The yellow light status of the project was also discussed. Mr. Brown said that the most rich part
    of the proposal was the maze generation aspect. The idea of researching algorithms instead of trying
    to blindly make one was reaffirmed. A group member later looked up different maze generation algorithms
    and understood the process much better. The proposal to skype and discuss the algorithms was proposed
    but did not work out due to schedule conflicts amongst the group. The plan is for the group to discuss the
    algs today in class and make sure each member understands the algs so that we can better implement them.
