<i>Current Presentation...</i> 
<ul> 
<li> Once the processing file is run, the program will show the algorithm created in order to randomly generate a maze given a starting point and an end point. This utilizes the data structure of a stack as well as the algorithmic strategy of backtracking in order to yield a complex maze with a given beginning and end point. </li>
<li> In addition, there is a ball that is invoked. As of now, all that the ball does is spawns at a random position on board and has the ability to move. </li> 
</ul> 

<i>Goals for this Game...</i>
<ul> 
<li> The ball will not only have the ability to move, but will be only allowed to follow path, not the walls. The movement of the ball will be dictated by the arrow keys and WASD movement. </li>
<li> There will be a blinded aspect, where only a couple of squares ahead are visible. </li> 
<li> The maze generation portion of this simulation will not be the final part of this. The game board that is formulated as a result of the maze generation algorithm would be forced to interact with the character class in order to run the game correctly. Most likely this would require the finalized file to be called Driver.pde as a part of the Driver folder. </li> 
<li> There will be an aspect of a certain amount of lives that will be presented on the game board. </li> 
<li> There will be a time aspect to the game that will be presented on the game board. </li> 
</ul>
