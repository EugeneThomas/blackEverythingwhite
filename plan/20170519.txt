For today, May 19th, our plans are... 

Which jobs are most crucial?
- Beginning to develop an algorithm for creating the board in our project.
- Creating the character and "square" classes to get the simplest stuff out of the way now. 
- Fleshing out all of the rules of the game.
 
Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
- Core functionality: 
	+ The creation of a board (with squares that are empty, some are traps, some have lives, etc.) 
	+ The creation of a character (with lives, the ability to move, etc.) 
- Inessential: 
	+ High amounts of visual using processing, it would look nice, but in theory, we can use the 
	  terminal. 

Which components are prerequisites for others?
- The creation of a simple board (just a formation of squares) is the prerequisite for a more advanced board, 
in which each square is unique. 
- The creation of a simple character (that only has the ability to move) is the prerequisite for a mroe advanced
character, who has the ability to interact with the board. 

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
- Delegated Tasks: 
	+ Creating the simple character and board classes. 
	+ Sketching out the functionality of each square in the board.
	+ Planning out the more advanced abilities of the character. 
- Collaborative Tasks: 
	+ Sketching out the algorithm to create a board while keeping in mind: 
		=> The exit of the board has to be reached
		=> Every component (obstacle and lives) have to be accessible
		=> It must be a challenge to reach the board (must take a certain number of steps to reach it).
