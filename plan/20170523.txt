As of May 23, 2017, our plans are...

Which jobs are most crucial?
- The development of an algorithm to create the board in our project. This would entail...
	=> Seeing if there is a possible solution (a maze-solving code that we might add in as a part of our prompt to play again). 
	=> Seeing if the solution is too easy (an algorithm that sees how many moves it would take the character to optimally win the game, 
	   if it is below that number, we must create a new board). 
	=> Seeing all of the mechanisms for regaining a life as well as obstacles are accessible, not obstructed by walls. 

- Creating the character and "square" classes, to identify what properties each of these things have. 
	- Characters have...
		=> The ability to move.
		=> The property of being dead or alive.
		=> A certain amount of lives 
		*=> Constant Visuals (Shape [circle], Size)
		*=> Varying Visuals (Color)
		=> Position 
		=> The ability to interact with the square at its position. 
		
	- Squares have...
		=> Position
		=> "Trichotomy": Travelled on, Not travelled on, Can be travelled on within one move. 
		=> Can hold a wall, an obstacle, a life, or be blank. 
		*=> Based on the "trichotomy" a color can be assigned. 

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?

	- Core functionality: 
		+ The creation of a board (with squares that are empty, some are traps, some have lives, etc.) 
		+ The creation of a character (with lives, the ability to move, etc.) 
	- Inessential: 
		+ High amounts of visual using processing, it would look nice, but in theory, we can use the 
		  terminal. 

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
	- Delegated Tasks: 
		+ Creating the simple character and square classes.  
	- Collaborative Tasks: 
		+ Sketching out the algorithm to create a board while keeping in mind: 
			=> The exit of the board has to be reached
			=> Every component (obstacle and lives) have to be accessible
			=> It must be a challenge to reach the board (must take a certain number of steps to reach it).
