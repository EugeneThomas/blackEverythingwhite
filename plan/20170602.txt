As of June 2, 2017, our plans are to

/*
Go through all the musts and then make a second pass for shoulds
*/


1. Develop the character class and make it work in compliance with the current maze generation alg 
	- Characters must be able to
	  + Move throughout the maze, any simple movement will do for now
	  + Move without phasing through walls like Barry Allen
	    => Either be aware of surrounding squares or check current tile color
	    
	- Characters should be able to
	  + Win the game by getting to an end space
	  + Lose the game by running out of time and dying
	  + Reset position upon death
	  + Move smoothly
	    => Use dx, dy


2. Develop a game class to have a timer and numLives tracker to run the actual game
   	- The game should be able to
	  + Track time
	  + Track player lives
	  + Reset upon player death
	  + End if player loses / advance if player wins


3. Have each group member code a maze generation algorithm ( different algs also =  different maze difficulty )

(We want to do this collaboratively but each member will take a lead role in the development of at least one algo)

   	- There should be implementations for
	  + Kruskal's algorithm
	  + Prim's algorithm
	  + Recursive division algorithm

	- If time after everything else
	  + Implement more algorithms

4. If time:

	- Check game difficulty and add features such as:
	  + Vision radius that you use to uncover map
	  + Obstacles

NOTE: For June 2nd, at most, only one of our team members will be present but the others take time to code on their five hour bus ride :).
